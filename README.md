## Abstract

Rett Syndrome (RTT), a human neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe cognitive and motor impairments, is caused by dysfunction of the conserved transcriptional regulator Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Genetic analyses in mouse *Mecp2* mutants, which exhibit key features of human RTT, have been essential for deciphering the mechanisms of MeCP2 function; nonetheless, our understanding of these complex mechanisms is incomplete. Zebrafish *mecp2* mutants exhibit mild behavioral deficits but have not been analyzed in depth. Here we combine transcriptomic and behavioral assays to assess baseline and stimulus-evoked motor responses and sensory filtering in zebrafish *mecp2* mutants from 5-7 days post-fertilization (dpf). We show that zebrafish *mecp2* function is dispensable for gross movement, acoustic startle response, and sensory filtering (habituation and sensorimotor gating), and reveal a previously unknown role for *mecp2* in behavioral responses to visual stimuli. RNA-seq analysis identified a large gene set that requires *mecp2* function for correct transcription at 4 dpf, and pathway analysis revealed several pathways that require MeCP2 function in both zebrafish and mammals. These findings show that MeCP2's function as a transcriptional regulator is conserved across vertebrates and supports using zebrafish to complement mouse modeling in elucidating these conserved mechanisms.
